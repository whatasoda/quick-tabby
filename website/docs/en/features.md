# Features

QuickTabby is a Chrome extension that makes tab switching fast and efficient.

## MRU (Most Recently Used) Tracking

QuickTabby automatically tracks which tabs you've used most recently. When you open the popup, tabs are sorted by recency, so your most relevant tabs are always at the top.

## Keyboard-First Navigation

Navigate through tabs without touching your mouse:

- **Alt+Q** - Open QuickTabby popup
- **↑/↓** or **j/k** - Move selection up/down
- **Enter** - Switch to selected tab
- **Esc** - Close popup

## Fuzzy Search

Start typing to filter tabs. QuickTabby uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type exact matches:

- Type "git" to find "GitHub - Your Repository"
- Type "mail" to find "Gmail - Inbox"

## Multi-Window Support

Switch between tabs across all browser windows, or focus on just the current window:

- **Alt+Shift+A** - All windows mode
- **Alt+Shift+C** - Current window mode

## Tab Thumbnails

See visual previews of your tabs to quickly identify the one you're looking for.
